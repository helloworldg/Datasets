# Datasets
This repository contains a portion of the task-instruction-prompts and role-definition-prompts dataset used in our research. This subset is provided for demonstration purposes to showcase the design and structure of the dataset. It serves as a concrete example of how our proposed framework organizes and generates prompts to enhance the code generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

By including carefully crafted task-instruction-prompts, which guide models in understanding and executing NL2Code tasks, and role-definition-prompts, which define specific roles such as "programmer" or "code reviewer," this dataset reflects the innovative methodologies employed in our work. These datasets illustrate our efforts to bridge the gap between user demands and effective LLM-driven code generation.

We hope this resource will provide researchers with valuable insights into the design of prompt-based frameworks for LLMs.

Key Features:
Dataset Structure:

Task-Instruction Prompts: Detailed prompts that define task objectives, provide background information, and specify execution requirements for programming tasks.
Role-Definition Prompts: Concise definitions of roles, outlining responsibilities and objectives for specialized tasks .

Relevance and Originality:

This dataset showcases our approach to prompt engineering, combining task-specific instructions with role-based guidance to optimize LLM performance.
